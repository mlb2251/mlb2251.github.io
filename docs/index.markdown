I'm a PhD student at MIT co-advised by [Armando Solar-Lezama](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) in EECS and [Josh Tenenbaum](http://cocosci.mit.edu/josh) in BCS. My research is in combining methods from programming languages (PL) research with machine learning to tackle problems in artificial intelligence.

# Research Interests

My research interests center on program synthesis and artificial intelligence. I‚Äôm particularly interested in [neurosymbolic methods](http://www.neurosymbolic.org/methods.html) that bridge the machine learning and programming languages communities. I believe symbolic methods can augment neural methods to facilitate low-data learning, generalization, transfer learning, interpretability, and other desiderata.

I'm particularly interested in abstraction learning, as in Ellis et al.'s [DreamCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381). I recently led a follow up work called Stitch ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16605) & [code](https://github.com/mlb2251/stitch)) which has been accepted to POPL 2023 and achieves a 1,000-10,000x speedup in abstraction learning over DreamCoder. I'm interested in exploring new applications of abstraction learning, and I'm particularly interested in its application to game-playing environments in world-model building and policy learning.

<!-- Prior to Stitch I worked with Max Nye on [Representing Partial Programs with Blended Abstract Semantics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.12964) at ICLR 2021, and I continue to be interested of new ways of representing programs and guiding search. Search mechanisms that use learned symbolic components are particularlly interesting to me, like the predicate learning of Odena et al. in [BUSTLE: Bottom-Up Program Synthesis Through Learning-Guided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14381) and [Learning to Represent Programs with Property Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09030). -->

<!-- I worked in chemistry in the past and am also interested in applications of neurosymbolic program synthesis to developing interpretable scientific models, as in our [NSF Expeditions](http://www.neurosymbolic.org/) project. -->

<!-- # Background
In 2020 I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in Computer Science and a BA in Chemistry. At Columbia, I worked with Professor Angelo Cacciuto on chemical simulations of self-assembling colloids and authored two publications:
- Das, S., Lee Bowers, M., Bakker, C., & Cacciuto, A. (2019). Active sculpting of colloidal crystals. *The Journal of Chemical Physics*, 150 (13), 134505.
- Mallory, S., Lee Bowers, M., & Cacciuto, A. (2020). Universal reshaping of arrested colloidal gels via active doping. *The Journal of Chemical Physics*, 153, 084901.

In the summer of 2019, I worked in the [Learning Matter Group](http://gomezbombarelli.mit.edu/) at MIT under Professor Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli, where I applied graph neural network methods to molecular property prediction. I'm interested in combining these methods with program synthesis techniques in a chemical domain in the future. -->

<!-- # Fun Stuff-->

<!--I wrote [Coral](https://github.com/jacobaustin123/Coral), a gradually-typed Python compiler which runs type inference and generates fast equivalent LLVM-IR code whenever possible.-->

<!--I wrote [Espresso](https://github.com/mlb2251/espresso), a Bash-Python hybrid shell that I used for several years, though I've recently migrated to [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/).-->

<!--I like writing my own tools and libraries to speed up development, some of which I've packaged into the [mlb](https://github.com/mlb2251/mlb) Python library.-->
